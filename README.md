# Automated disaster tweet classification using deep learning: Enhancing real-time crisis response

In this project, I developed various deep learning models to distinguish between disaster-related and non-disaster-related Tweets. The goal was to improve the accuracy and efficiency of identifying real disaster information on social media, which is important for effective disaster response and management.

Using a labeled dataset from Kaggle, I explored different neural network architectures, including shallow neural networks, multilayer models, bidirectional LSTM networks, and transformers. The project involved a structured approach, starting with data loading and exploration, followed by comprehensive text preprocessing to prepare the data for modeling.

I employed various visualization techniques to understand the dataset better, such as word clouds to identify common words in disaster-related and non-disaster-related Tweets. The core of the project focused on building and evaluating multiple deep learning models to determine the most effective architecture for this classification task.

The results demonstrated the potential of deep learning in natural language processing, particularly for real-time disaster monitoring and response. This work can be further refined to develop robust systems that assist in disaster management, ultimately saving lives and reducing the impact of disasters.
